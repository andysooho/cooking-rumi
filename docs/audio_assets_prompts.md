> [!TIP]
> **ElevenLabs Generation Tips:**
> - For **BGM tracks**, generate longer durations and trim to create seamless loops
> - For **SFX**, keep them short and punchy — trim silence from beginning and end
> - Add **"8-bit"** or **"chiptune"** keywords to maintain retro consistency across all audio
> - Test loop points for BGM by playing them back-to-back before finalizing
> - Export all files as **MP3 (192kbps+)** for web compatibility, with **OGG fallback** for broader browser support
> - Normalize volume levels across all SFX to avoid jarring loudness differences
